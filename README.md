##TCP Online##
####Developed by Zach Zarrow####

TCP Online is an appointment booking and CRM tool built from scratch for the Technical Communication Program (TCP) at the University of Pennsylvania.  I coded this during the Summer of 2011 using PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS/JS, and CRON. The application passed a security review and was hosted on the engineering school's servers until 2013 when the Technical Communication Program was repurposed.

The TCP Fellows would log in and enter their availability for meeting with students.  When Penn Engineering students logged in, they could book an appointment: They selected their preferred TCP Fellow, or they selected their preferred time, and the system guided them through booking a suitable appointment block.

The system included e-mail notifications at time-of-booking, day-before appointment notifications for students, multi-level user authentication (Student, fellow, director, intern, sysadmin), Fellow control panel, Director control panel, Admin control panel, e-mail digests of upcoming appointments for Fellows, and full appointment management/cancellation/rebooking support.

After I graduated, TCP Online remained fully-functional and operational without any developer support.
